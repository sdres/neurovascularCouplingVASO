# Notes

Dear Participant,

Thank you for joining this experiment.

In this study, we are examining the responses in the brain to stimuli of different durations. We know that the response takes much longer than the actual stimuli. Therefore, we have long gaps (10-24 s) between successive trials. Please keep your fixation on the dot in the middle of the screen at all times. This dot has a black center and a yellow surround. Remember to keep as still as possible during the entire experiment and breathe naturally. Do not synchronise your breath with the stimulus.

To make this experiment more entertaining, we have included some "targets". Here, the surround of the central dot will turn red for a short while. If you see the color switch, please press button 1 on the button box. Speed is not important here. Note however that the response should be within a 2 second window after target occurrence. You will get feedback on your performance after each run.

As you know. This experiment has 5 sessions. In session 1, we will acquire and anatomical image of your brain, which takes about 10 minutes, and 5 runs of stimulation (12 minutes, each). You can take short rests between the runs.
In sessions 2-4 we will only do stimulation runs (6 runs of 12 minutes, each). In the final session, we will acquire a different type of anatomical data. Here, we will acquire 4 runs of 15 minutes, each.

Of course, your participation is entirely voluntary and you can withdraw at any time.
If you have any questions, please let us know.
